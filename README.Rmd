The RMAVIS R Shiny web application is a tool to assist in the assignment of vegetation plot
sample data to UK National Vegetation Classification units, with additional exploratory analyses.

## Running the app

You can run RMAVIS from [GitHub](https://github.com/ZekeMarshall/RMAVIS) by cloning the 
repository, calling `renv::restore()`, and then calling `shiny::runApp("app.R")`.

If `renv::restore()` fails run `install.packages(unique(renv::dependencies()$Package), dependencies = TRUE)`.
Note that whilst the correct dependencies will be installed, 
the versions may not match those in the renv.lock file,
and so the correct functioning of the app cannot be guaranteed.
