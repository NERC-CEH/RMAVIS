## Overview

The **R** **M**odular **A**nalysis of **V**egetation **I**nformation **S**ystem 
(`RMAVIS`) R Shiny web application is a tool to assist in the assignment of 
vegetation plot sample data to GB National Vegetation Classification units,
with additional exploratory analyses.

We will update and improve `RMAVIS` over time in response to user feedback and hope it acts as a useful
tool for the GB ecology and conservation community.

## Structure

There are 8 main sections in `RMAVIS` at present.

**Home** - Provides outlining information.

**Data Entry** - Facilitates data entry and makes available the taxonomic information used by `RMAVIS`.

**NVC Analysis** - The core of the `RMAVIS` application, containing the functionality present in the original v1.0 release.

**NVC Information** - Contains a set of searchable tables for inspecting the NVC community names, taxon names, floristic tables, and community attributes.

**Documentation** - Provides a more detailed overview of the underlying methods, data sources, and usage instructions.

**News** - Contains the release log and additional news regarding the development and maintenance of `RMAVIS`.

**Additional Information** - Contains other useful information.

**Privacy** - A privacy notice.

## Running Locally

In addition to accessing `RMAVIS` via the web `RMAVIS` can be run on your personal device and installed as an R package.

To run RMAVIS locally take the following steps.

1.  Ensure R >= 4.4 is installed.
2.  Install `RMAVIS` using `remotes::install_github("NERC-CEH/RMAVIS")`
3.  Run `install.packages("tinytex")` then `tinytex::install_tinytex()` to install a minimal LaTeX distribution.
    This is required to generate a pdf report.
    Note that this is only required if you do not have a LaTeX distribution already installed.
4.  From the R terminal run `RMAVIS::runApp()`.

If you wish to use the NVC-matching functions outside of the `RMAVIS` app, 
these are also made available through the `RMAVIS` package.
