The RMAVIS R shiny web application is a tool to assist in the assignment of vegetation plot
sample data to UK National Vegetation Classification units, with additional exploratory analysis.

## Running the app

You can run RMAVIS from [GitHub](https://github.com/ZekeMarshall/RMAVIS) by cloning the 
repository, calling `renv::restore()`, and then calling `shiny::runApp("app.R")`.

If `renv::restore()` fails run `install.packages(unique(renv::dependencies()$Package), dependencies = TRUE)`. 

Future developments may support the release of RMAVIS as an R package.

## Hosting

### Posit Connect

RMAVIS is currently hosted on the UKCEH Posit Connect server:

### Docker

RMAVIS is configured to be built with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

To build and deploy the app on a linux server with Docker pre-installed two approaches may be taken:

### Using Docker Manually

1. Build the app locally with `docker build --no-cache -t <container registry url>/rmavis:<version> .`.
2. Log in to the container registry with `docker login <container registry url>`, using a API key.
3. Push the image to the container registry with `docker push <container registry url>/rmavis:<version>`.
One of:
4a. Log into a container registry UI through a web browser, and navigate to a console button which opens a terminal to the server.
4b. ssh into the server from a local terminal.
5. In the server, log in to the container registry with `docker login registry.digitalocean.com`, using a API key.
6. Pull the image from the container registry with `docker pull <container registry url>/rmavis:<version>`.
7. Check that the image has been successfully retrieved with `docker images`.
8. Check whether there is a container currently running with `docker ps -a`.
9. Stop and remove this instance with `docker rm -f <instance name>`.
9. Run the Docker container in a new instance with `docker run -d -p 8001:8001 --privileged=true --name <instance name> <container registry url>/rmavis:<version>`.

### Using Docker Compose

1. Build the app image locally with `docker compose build.`.
2. Log in to a container registry with `docker login <container registry url>`, using a API key.
3. Push the image to the container registry with `docker compose push`.
One of:
4a. Log into a container registry UI through a web browser, and navigate to a console button which opens a terminal to the server.
4b. ssh into the server from a local terminal.
5. In the server, log in to a container registry with `docker login <container registry url>`, using a API key.
6. Check whether there is a container currently running with the same name using `docker ps -a`.
7. Optionally, stop and remove this instance with `docker rm -f <instance name>`.
8. Run the Docker container in a new, or updated instance with `docker compose up --detach`.
