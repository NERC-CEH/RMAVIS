# Introduction

The Modular Analysis of Vegetation Information System (MAVIS), originally 
developed by [@smart2016mavis]

## Aims

MAVIS aims to...

1.  Assist in the assignment of a set of sample quadrats to
    the closest NVC communities.
2.  Assist in the identification of site properties.
3.  ... This element of MAVIS is intended as an exploratory
    tool, not ....

## Scope

MAVIS is designed to analyse vegetation survey data in the
form of grouped or ungrouped quadrats, for a single site,
with or without cover estimates.

# Instructions and Methodology

## Survey Data

### Requirements

-   Each species value must match a species present in the
    accepted species list.
-   Each quadrat value must be unique, even if in a separate
    group.
-   Each year value must be a four digit integer.

Three methods for entering data into MAVIS are provided;
manual, upload, and example.

The list of species available for entry is currently
composed of:

-   The vascular plants present in @stace2010new, retrieved
    from @bsbi2014stace.
-   The bryophytes present in @blockeel2021.
-   The lichens, charophytes, and Algae present in the NVC
    floristic tables.

### Manual Entry

### Upload

### Example Data

Three example datasets are bundled with MAVIS, which provide
a means to explore the applications functionality.

**Parsonage Down** CG. Calcareous grassland. Transect
Survey. Repeat quadrats in 1970, 1990, and 2016
[@ridding2020]

**Leith** W. Bunce woodland Survey. Storm Track. Repeat
quadrats 1971, 2001, and 2021 [@smart2014]

**Whitwell Common** M. Norfolk Mires. Repeat quadrats 1994
and 1997. [@smart2000]

**Newborough Warren**. SD. Repeat quadrats. 2014 to 2018. [@wallace2018]

## NVC Assignment

### Czekanowski Index

The Czekanowski index [@bloom1981] (see Equation~\ref{eq:czekanowski}) to 
quantify the similarity between a floristic table composed from survey data 
(with a minimum of five samples recommended) and the NVC floristic tables, or a 
subset thereof.

$$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:czekanowski}
= 200 * \sum_{j=1} ^{t} min(REF_{j}, NS_{j}) / \sum_{j=1} ^{m} REF_{j} + \sum_{j=1} ^{n} NS_{j}
\end{equation}
$$
Where $REF_{j}$ is the Domin cover or constancy value of species $j$ in the 
constancy table. $NS_{j}$ is the corresponding Domin cover or constancyt value 
for the same species but in the new, sample data. $min(REF_{j}, NS_{j})$ is the 
smaller of the two values [@smart2000].

### Jaccard Similarity

An R implementation of the method outlined in @tipping2013.
This method calculates the Jaccard similarity between user-inputted sample 
quadrats and a set of pseudo-quadrats. This approach is noted as improving the
accuracy of fit relative to the Czekanowski index for sample quadrats with low
species richness [@tipping2013].

### Inverse Distance Metric

@critchley2002.

## Habitat Correspondences

Habitat correspondence data is drawn from three sources:

1.  The Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) Spreadsheet of Habitat 
Correspondences [@jncc2008].
2.  UKHab V1.1 [@butcher2020].
3.  For the National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) data is drawn from 
[@pescott2019]

## Floristic Tables

To aid in the NVC assignment process and as an exploratory tool the 
**Floristic Tables** section of MAVIS allows the user to compare a composed 
floristic table to a chosen NVC floristic table.

## Analysis Metrics

... uses the results of the NVC Assignment module to calculate the following 
metrics:

-   Cover-weighted Hill-Ellenberg ecological indicator
    values:
    -   Nitrogen Score (N) [@bsbi2017ellenbergN]
    -   Moisture Score (F) [@bsbi2017ellenbergF]
    -   Reaction Score (R) [@bsbi2017ellenbergR]
    -   Salinity Score (S) [@bsbi2017ellenbergS]
    -   Light Score (L) [@bsbi2017ellenbergL]
-   

Data for bryophytes was taken from BRYOATT [@hill2007] and data for vascular 
plants was taken from.

## Diversity

Metrics assessed:

-   Total Species Richness
-   Simpson's Diversity Index [@simpson1949].
-   Beta diversity [@koleff2003]

## Ordination

The ordination section of MAVIS aims to allow the user to
explore...
