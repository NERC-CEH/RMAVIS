The RMAVIS R Shiny web application is a tool to assist in the assignment
of vegetation plot sample data to UK National Vegetation Classification
units, with additional exploratory analyses.

## Running the app

You can run RMAVIS from [GitHub](https://github.com/ZekeMarshall/RMAVIS)
by cloning the repository, calling `renv::restore()`, and then calling
`shiny::runApp("app.R")`.

If `renv::restore()` fails run
`install.packages(unique(renv::dependencies()$Package), dependencies = TRUE)`.
Note that whilst the correct dependencies will be installed, the
versions may not match those in the renv.lock file.
