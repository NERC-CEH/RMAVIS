# Introduction

The assignment of vegetation sample plot data to established vegetation 
classification units using computational methods is a well established and 
recognised practice [@maciejewski2020]. 
The results of this assignment process are used in various ways, 
including assisting in the phase 2 habitat survey
(or NVC survey) [@rodwell2006national] process; 
establishing an ecological baseline and identifying important ecological 
features such as protected habitats [@cieem2022]; 
and in ecological restoration by providing a proxy for historical reference 
ecosystems to target and against which to measure restoration progress 
[@pywell2002; @gann2019; @sturbois2023].

In the Great Britain (GB) the development of computational methods and programs 
for the assignment of vegetation survey data to NVC communities began with the 
development of TABLEFIT [@hill1989; @marrs2019] and was followed by MATCH 
[@malloch1998].
The most recent program, the Modular Analysis of Vegetation Information System 
(MAVIS), was developed as a windows application in 2000 and was a DEFRA-funded
output of the ECOFACT project [@bunce1999], with the latest version released in 
2016 [@smart2016mavis].

This R Shiny implementation of MAVIS (`RMAVIS`) is the newest program in this
series, aiming to provide a web-based and easily operable system which
can be updated and improved over time in response to user needs.

# Instructions and Methodology

## Data Entry

The Data Entry group of modules contains the Data Input, Data Structure, and
Validation, and Taxonomic Backbone modules.

### Options

**Input Method**

Three methods for entering data into `RMAVIS` are provided: manual, upload,
and example. The manual method allows the user to enter the data
directly via editing the cells of the survey data table, or copying the
data in. The upload method allows the user to upload the data in one of
three formats: long, wide, and matrix. The example method allows the
user to load a bundled dataset, in order to demonstrate the
functionality of the app.
The basic unit of data consists of a five column table containing the following
information:

-   **Year**: The year the quadrat was surveyed.
-   **Group**: Names for each group of quadrats.
-   **Quadrat**: Names for each sample quadrat.
-   **Species**: Taxon names.
-   **Cover**: Optionally, cover values.


```{r dataEntryScreenshot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "The Data Input section of `RMAVIS` displaying the input data from Whitwell Common example dataset, which is correctly formatted. Note that the absence of cover values requires the 'None' to be selected in the 'Cover Scale' option.", out.width = '100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./screenshots/data_entry.png", rel_path = FALSE)
```


At present `RMAVIS` does not support the entry of constancy tables.

**Example Dataset**

Four example datasets are available in `RMAVIS`, which provide a means to
explore the applications functionality.

-   **Parsonage Down**:
    The Parsonage Down dataset [@ridding2020] contains the results of a
    long-term survey of Parsonage Down National Nature Reserve in Wiltshire,
    which consists of 188ha of calcareous grassland. The site was surveyed
    in three years: 1970, 1990, and 2016. Four transects were surveyed,
    containing a total of 115 quadrats. Domin cover values are provided.

-   **Leith Hill Place Wood**:
    The Leith Hill Place Wood dataset represents a subset of the Bunce
    woodland survey data, described in @wood2015 and consists of a total of
    16 plots surveyed in 1971, 2001, and 2021 [@smart2024]. Leith Hill Place
    Wood lies in the path of the October 1987 storm track, with @smart2014
    outlining the positive effect of the storm on species richness between
    1971 and 2001. No cover values are currently provided in this example
    dataset.

-   **Whitwell Common**:
    The Whitwell Common dataset is composed of a repeat survey of Whitwell
    Common, Norfolk - a soligenous mire. Thirty repeat quadrats were
    surveyed in 1994 and 1997 [@smart2000]. No cover values are currently
    provided in this example dataset.

-   **Newborough Warren**:
    The Newborough Warren dataset contains the results of a yearly
    monitoring study at Newborough Warren (Ynys Llanddwyn SSSI, Anglesey)
    with four dune slacks surveyed over five years: 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017,
    and 2018 (which contain 18, 19, 18, 24, and 24 quadrats respectively)
    [@wallace2018]. Percentage cover values are provided.

**Cover Scale**

Four cover scales are available for selection.

-   **Percentage**: A value greater than 0 and less than equal to 100.
-   **Proportional**: A value greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.
-   **Domin**: The Domin cover scale as outlined in @rodwell2006national (+, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).
-   **Braun-Blanquet**: The 5 point Braun-Blanquet cover scale as outlined in @braun-blanquet1964 (+, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

We recommend the use of percentage or proportional cover values where possible 
to avoid information loss [@dengler2023].

**Validation**

Pressing the Validation button opens the survey data validation pop up.

At present `RMAVIS` is designed to analyse vegetation survey data in the
form of grouped quadrats for a single site, with or without cover
estimates.

Data entered through any of these methods must meet the following
conditions.

-   Each species value must match a species present in the accepted
    species list, which can be downloaded in the "Download Options"
    section.
-   There must be no missing values in the year, group, quadrat, and
    species columns.
-   A quadrat value may not exist in more than one group.
-   Each group value must be unique in each year.
-   Each year value must be a four digit integer.
-   No quadrat must contain two entries of the same species.

These conditions are checked and can be viewed in the **Survey Data
Validation** section, accessed by pressing the "Validate Survey Data"
button. Here the user may adjust the species which are not present in
the accepted list using the "Species Adjustment Table", three options
are provided:

-   Replace a submitted species with a accepted species.
-   Ignore a submitted species. This omits the species from the NVC
    assignment process.
-   Remove a submitted species. This removes a species (or entry in the
    species column) in the survey table.

The user may also combine duplicate observations of a species in
quadrats using the "Combine Duplicates" button.

Until these conditions are met `RMAVIS` will not be able to proceed as
the "Run Analysis" and "Generate Report" buttons will be disabled.

**Clear Table**

The clear table button resets the survey data input table.

### Taxonomic backbone

The Taxonomic Backbone section provides an interface to explore the taxonomic backbone underpinning RMAVIS.
This backbone is currently composed of the recommended taxa in 
version 0250703a of the UKSI (https://data.nhm.ac.uk/dataset/uk-species-inventory-simplified-copy)
from the following informal groups: alga, chromist, clubmoss, conifer, fern, 
flowering plant, ginkgo, hornwort, horsetail, lichen, liverwort, moss, quillwort, stonewort.
    
### Download

Available for download are:

-   **Accepted Taxa:** the taxa accepted by RMAVIS and associated UKSI taxon version keys.
-   **Taxonomic Backbone:** the taxonomic backbone used in RMAVIS, equal to the `UKVegTB::taxonomic_backbone` object.
-   **Taxon Lookup:** a lookup between the recommended taxon names as present in the Taxonomic Backbone, and available synonyms in the UKSI, equal to the `UKVegTB::taxa_lookup` object.
-   **Survey Data:** the survey data entered into the data entry table.

## NVC Assignment

### Similarity Indices

In `RMAVIS` NVC community similarities are assigned to survey data for the
site and each group of plots by year using the Czekanowski quantitative
coefficient of similarity [@bloom1981; @hill1989],
as implemented in MATCH [@malloch1999], and also known as the Steinhaus 
coefficient.
The Czekanowski coefficient quantifies the similarity 
between 1) a floristic table composed from survey data plots and 
2) the NVC floristic tables; with the ordinal constancy classes of I-V, replaced
with the numeric values 1-5.
Species absent from the survey data, but present in the NVC
floristic tables at a constancy of 1 are down-weighted to 0.1. 

\begin{equation}
C_{jk} = 2 \cdot \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{p} min(N_{ij}, N_{ik})}{\sum_{i=1}^{p} N_{ij} + \sum_{i=1}^{p} N_{ik}}
\end{equation}

Where where $N_{ij}$ is the abundance of species $i$ at site $j$, $N_{ik}$ is 
the abundance of species $i$ at site $k$, $p$ is the total number of species 
in the samples.

The similarity between individual plots and NVC communities are quantified
by calculating the Jaccard coefficient of similarity between the sample plots 
and pseudo-quadrats generated from the NVC floristic tables. This approach
is noted as improving the accuracy of fit relative to the Czekanowski
coefficient for samples with low species richness [@tipping2013].

\begin{equation}
j = \frac{a}{a + b + c} = \frac{X \cap Y}{X \cup Y} = \frac{X \cap Y}{X + Y - X \cap Y}
\end{equation}

Where where $X$ and $Y$ represent the species present in two sites, 
$a$ represents the species present in both sites ($X$ and $Y$), 
$b$ represents the species present in one site but not the other (${X \cap Y}$), 
and the converse for $c$ (${X \cup Y}$).

> Please note that Site and Group similarities will not be calculated
> for Years and Year-Group combinations with less than 2 sample plots.
> It is highly reccomended that 5 or more plots are in each group.

### Pseudo-Quadrat Methodology

The pseudo-quadrat method as outlined in @tipping2013 and
first developed in @rushton1996 and @critchley2002
uses a Bernoulli trial to determine the presence or
absence of each species, with the probability of a successful trial
equal to the relative frequency of occurrence of each species in a NVC
community or sub-community (unit). The relative frequency/probability
values are derived from the ordinal constancy classes used in the NVC 
[@rodwell2006national], specifically the mid-point of the percentage ranges which form 
the constancy classes, such that V (81-100%) = 0.9, IV (61-80%) = 0.7, III
(41-60%) = 0.5, II (21-40%) = 0.3, and I (1-20%) = 0.1. These values were
taken in the absence of the actual relative frequencies of each species
in each NVC unit.
The number of pseudo-quadrats is currently equal to the number of samples
used to define the original unit, with the exception of the Scottish oceanic
wet grassland communities for which 25 pseudo-quadrats were generated, which
represents the estimated optimum.
Work to determine the optimum number of pseudo-quadrats is ongoing.

### Communities

The sets of 'NVC' communities available in `RMAVIS`:

**Original**

-   The original NVC floristic tables as described in the original NVC volumes
    [@rodwell1991;@rodwell1992;@rodwell1992a;@rodwell1995;@rodwell2000].
    
**Calthion**

-   An alternative version of MG4 (MG4v2) and the four MG4
    sub-communities described in @prosser2023 and @wallace2017 (MG4v2a,
    MG4v2b, MG4v2c, and MG4v2d).
-   A new MG6 sub-community (MG6d) [@wallace2017]
-   An alternative version of MG8 (MG8v2) and the four sub-communities
    described in @wallace2017 (MG8v2a, MG8v2b, MG8v2c, and MG8v2d).
-   An alternative version of MG13 (MG13v2) [@wallace2017].
-   A new MG community (MG14) and two sub-communities (MG14a, MG14b)
    [@wallace2017].
-   A new MG community (MG15) and two sub-communities (MG15a, MG15b)
    [@wallace2017].
-   A new MG community (MG16) [@wallace2017].

**SOWG**

-   A new set of Scottish Oceanic Wet Grassland Communities as
    described in @wallace2023.
    
Communities for which no floristic tables were produced and are therefore
unavailable in `RMAVIS` are: A6, M30, M36, SM27, and W6c.

### Options

**Assign Quadrats**

Optionally calculate similarity values for individual quadrats.
If the user only wishes to assign NVC community similarity values for
groups of quadrats or all quadrats in a year disable this option.
Note that the Jaccard similarity calculations for individual quadrats can take
a long time for large samples, so it may also be desirable to disable then.
If there are less than two quadrats per year `RMAVIS` this option is set to 'Yes'
and disabled, as similarity values for years and/or groups which contain
less than two quadrats must be calculated using the Jaccard coefficient and 
reference pseudo-quadrats.

**Results to View**

Three sets of NVC assignment results are available in `RMAVIS` at present:

-   **Site, Czekanowski**
-   **Group, Czekanowski**
-   **Quadrat, Jaccard**

**Restrict Habitat**

Optionally restrict the NVC assignment process to one or more broad NVC
habitat types. This is recommended to increase the assignment speed.
Restricting habitat types in this way allows users to match quadrats to a
baseline reference and a target set of units.
For example, if restoring heathland from acid grassland you would choose just 
'H' and 'U' as containing the baseline and target habitats respectively.
However, in the case where some of the baseline plots might not fit in 'U' 
or if re-surveyed plots do not fit in 'U' or 'H' the plots may be wrongly 
assigned, as such the restriction of reference MNVC habitats should be carefully
considered.

**Number of Top Results**

Select the number of top-fitted NVC communities to view.

## Habitat Correspondence

The **Habitat Correspondence** section provides a means to explore the
habitats from alternative habitat classifications which are associated
with the top-fitted NVC communities assigned to the survey data.

Habitat correspondence data is drawn from four sources:

1.  The Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) Spreadsheet of
    Habitat Correspondences [@jncc2008].
2.  Version 9.5 of the JNCC habitat correspondences.
3.  UKHab V1.1 [@butcher2020].
4.  For the National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) data is drawn from
    [@pescott2019].

### Options

**Classification**

The user may select the habitat classification system from which to
retrieve associated habitats. At present the following systems are
available:

-   **Biodiversity Action Plan Priority Habitats** [@jncc2008]
-   **EU Habitats Directive Annex 1** [@jncc2008]
-   **Phase 1 Habitat Classification** [@jncc2008]
-   **Biodiversity Action Plan Broad Habitats** [@jncc2008]
-   **EUNIS Classification** [@jncc2008]
-   **NPMS Broad** [@pescott2019]
-   **NPMS Fine** [@pescott2019]
-   **UKHab - Level 2** [@butcher2020]
-   **UKHab - Level 3** [@butcher2020]
-   **UKHab - Level 4** [@butcher2020]
-   **UKHab - Level 5** [@butcher2020]

## Floristic Tables

To aid in the NVC assignment process and as an exploratory tool the
**Floristic Tables** section of `RMAVIS` allows the user to compare a
composed i.e. newly inputted, floristic table to a chosen NVC floristic table. 
Matching of the species in the composed table with NVC tables can be carries out
two ways as described below.

### Options

**View Options**

The user may choose to compare composed and NVC floristic tables, or view 
all composed tables across each year, or a groups composed tables each year by
selecting one of the two options below:

-   **Single Composed vs NVC**
-   **Multiple Composed**

**Restrict**

Restrict the NVC communities available to select in the "NVC Table"
option to the top-fitted NVC communities.

**NVC Table**

Select a NVC community to display the floristic table for.

**Composed Table**

Select a composed floristic table. The composed tables are formed by
calculating the frequency class of each species across all quadrats in
each year and year - group combination.

**Match Species**

The user may choose to re-arrange the floristic tables to match the
species present in both tables, three options are provided:

-   **No**: the floristic tables are displayed with no re-arrangement.
-   **Composed to NVC**: the composed floristic table is re-arranged to only
    include species also present in the NVC floristic table and aligned
    with the NVC floristic table.
-   **NVC to Composed**: the NVC floristic table is re-arranged to only
    include species also present in the composed floristic table and
    aligned with the composed floristic table.


```{r floristicTableScreenshot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "The Floristic Tables section of `RMAVIS` displaying a composed floristic table from all plots in 1994 from the Whitwell Common example dataset, with 'Composed to NVC' selected from the 'Match Species' option.", out.width = '100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./screenshots/floristic_table.png", rel_path = FALSE)
```


## Frequency

The **Frequency** section of `RMAVIS` summarises the number of occurrences
of each species across all sample plots, the difference between the
first year and last year, and a text category describing the change.

## EIVs

The Ecological Indicator Values (**EIVs**) section uses the results of
the **NVC Assignment** module to calculate cover-weighted Hill-Ellenberg
ecological indicator values for the Nitrogen Score (N)
[@bsbi2017ellenbergN], Moisture Score (F) [@bsbi2017ellenbergF],
Reaction Score (R) [@bsbi2017ellenbergR], Salinity Score (S)
[@bsbi2017ellenbergS], and Light Score (L) [@bsbi2017ellenbergL]. Data
for bryophytes was taken from BRYOATT [@hill2007].

### Options

At present six sets of results are available:

-   **Unweighted Mean Hill-Ellenberg Values, by Site**
-   **Weighted Mean Hill-Ellenberg Values, by Site**
-   **Unweighted Mean Hill-Ellenberg Values, by Group**
-   **Weighted Mean Hill-Ellenberg Values, by Group**
-   **Unweighted Mean Hill-Ellenberg Values, by Quadrat**
-   **Weighted Mean Hill-Ellenberg Values, by Quadrat**

## Diversity

The **Diversity** section allows the user to view a range of basic
diversity metrics.

### Options

**Results to View**

At present five sets of results are available:

-   **Site Summary Table**: contains the mean alpha diversity, gamma
    diversity, and beta diversity of the site with years arranged
    column-wise.
-   **Quadrat Diversity Indices Table**: contains the species richness,
    Shannon diversity, Simpson diversity, Inverse Simpson diversity,
    Shannon evenness, and Simpson evenness for each quadrat.
-   **Species Richness, by Site**: contains the species richness of the site
    with years arranged column-wise.
-   **Species Richness, by Group**: contains the species richness of each
    group with years arranged column-wise.
-   **Species Richness, by Quadrat**: contains the species richness of each
    quadrat with years arranged column-wise.

## MVA

The Multivariate Analysis (MVA) section of `RMAVIS` aims to allow the user
to explore the position of the survey data quadrats in an ordination
space constructed by performing a Detrended Correspondence Analysis
(DCA) [@hill1980dca]. The results of a Canonical Correspondence Analysis
(CCA) [@terBraak1986], using the pseudo-quadrats as the community matrix
and pre-calculated set of unweighted mean Hill-Ellenberg values for each
pseudo-quadrat as the constraining matrix, are available for visualising
in each MVA plot.

Three MVA methods are provided in `RMAVIS`, which are described below.

### National Reference

The ordination space in the **National Reference** MVA was constructed
by performing a pre-calculated DCA on the pseudo-quadrats from all NVC
communities, with the survey quadrats added in passively in `RMAVIS` using
the mean of the species scores from the pre-calculated pseudo-quadrat
DCA.

By default the top-fitted NVC communities retrieved from the **NVC
Assignment** process are displayed.

**Advantages**

-   The psuedo-quadrat axis scores are not influenced by the survey
    quadrats.
-   The position of the pseudo-quadrat axis scores are absolute. Adding
    or removing NVC communities from the plot using the "National
    Reference Spaces" option does not change the axis scores and
    position of the other NVC communities or survey quadrats.
-   The pseudo-quadrat DCA contains all the species present in the NVC
    floristic table, in comparison to the **Local Reference
    (restricted)** method.
-   The survey quadrat positions in the ordination space accurately
    reflect their similiarity with the pseudo-quadrats, and therefore
    the NVC communities and sub-communities.

**Disadvantages**

-   The pseudo-quadrat DCA scores for each sub-community within a
    community are compressed by the dissimilarity with other
    communities. Consequently there is a greater degree of overlap
    between the sub-communities, and the survey quadrats and
    sub-communities.

### Local Reference (restricted)

The ordination space in the **Local Reference (restricted)** MVA is
constructed by performing a DCA on the top-fitted NVC communities
retrieved from the **NVC Assignment** process with the survey quadrats
added in passively using the mean of the species scores from the
pseudo-quadrat DCA.

**Advantages**

-   The psuedo-quadrat axis scores are not influenced by the survey
    quadrats.
-   The pseudo-quadrat axis scores show greater variation due to the
    absence of highly dissimilar communities, in contrast to the
    **National Reference** method. Consequently, the (dis)similarity
    between the pseudo-quadrats and survey-quadrats is emphasised.

**Disadvantages**

-   Species present in the survey data but absent in the top-fitted NVC
    communities are omitted from the survey quadrat axis score
    calculation. Consequently, the similiarity between the survey
    quadrats and pseudo-quadrats (and therefore NVC communities and
    sub-communities) is over-estimated.
-   The axis scores and position of both the pseudo-quadrats and survey
    quadrats varies based on the NVC communities used in the
    pseudo-quadrat DCA.

### Local Reference (unrestricted)

The ordination space in the **Local Reference (unrestricted)** MVA is
constructed by performing a DCA on the top-fitted NVC communities *and*
the survey quadrats.

**Advantages**

-   All species present in both the survey quadrats and pseudo-quadrats
    contribute to the axis scores. Consequently, the (dis)similarity
    between the pseudo-quadrats and survey quadrats is correctly
    represented as in the **National Reference** method but the axis
    scores are not compressed by highly dissimilar communities.

**Disadvantages**

-   The inclusion of the survey quadrats in the DCA means that the
    pseudo-quadrats do not provide a fixed reference as in the
    **National Reference** and **Local Reference (restricted)** methods
    where the survey quadrats are added in passively.

### Options

**Axis Selection**

The user may select any combination of the first three DCA axis scores
to be displayed in the MVA plots:

-   **DCA1 vs DCA2**
-   **DCA1 vs DCA3**
-   **DCA2 vs DCA3**

**National Reference Spaces**

Here the user may select any NVC community to display in the **National
Reference** MVA plot only.

**Group Survey Plots**

Three options are available to 'group' the survey quadrat/plot data:

-   **No**: the individual plots are left ungrouped.
-   **Group**: mean DCA axis scores are calculated from the individual plots 
    by group.
-   **Year**: mean DCA axis scores are calculated from the individual plots
    by year.
    
    
```{r mvaUngroupedScreenshot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "The MVA section of `RMAVIS` displaying the position of the sample plots from the Whitwell Common example dataset in an ordination space constructed using the top-fitting NVC communities, with the 'Group Survey Plots' option set to 'No'.", out.width = '100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./screenshots/mva_ungrouped.png", rel_path = FALSE)
```


```{r mvaGroupedScreenshot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "The MVA section of `RMAVIS` displaying the position of the sample plots from the Whitwell Common example dataset in an ordination space constructed using the top-fitting NVC communities, with the 'Group Survey Plots' option set to 'Year'.", out.width = '100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./screenshots/mva_grouped.png", rel_path = FALSE)
```


**Survey Quadrat Selection**

Three methods are available for subsetting the survey quadrats being
displayed:

-   **Select Years**: where all the survey quadrats for selected years will
    be displayed.
-   **Select Groups**: where all the survey quadrats for selected groups
    will be displayed.
-   **Select Quadrats**: where all the survey quadrats for selected quadrats
    will be displayed.

**CCA Variables**

At present the CCA axis scores from each combination of Hill-Ellenberg
values are available for display in each MVA plot:

-   **Moisture (F) x Nitrogen (N)**
-   **Moisture (F) x Reaction (R)**
-   **Moisture (F) x Light (L)**
-   **Moisture (F) x Salinity (S)**
-   **Nitrogen (N) x Reaction (R)**
-   **Nitrogen (N) x Light (L)**
-   **Nitrogen (N) x Salinity (S)**
-   **Reaction (R) x Light (L)**
-   **Reaction (R) x Salinity (S)**
-   **Light (L) x Salinity (S)**

**Axis Scores**

The following results may be toggled on/off for display in the MVA
plots.

-   **Survey Quadrats**: the survey quadrats entered in **Survey Data**.
-   **Pseudo-Quadrats**: all pseudo-quadrats used in the DCA ordination.
-   **Reference Space**: the convex hulls formed around the pseudo-quadrats.
-   **Reference Centroids**: the centroids formed from the pseudo-quadrat DCA scores.
-   **Species**: the species DCA axis scores.
-   **Unique Survey Species**: the species present in the survey quadrats
    but absent in the top-fitted NVC communities pseudo-quadrats.
    Displayed in **Local Reference (unrestricted)** only.
-   **Hill-Ellenberg**: the Hill-Ellenberg CCA axis scores selected in the
    "CCA Variables" option.
-   **Trajectory**: arrows showing the direction of travel for
    individual quadrats in the ordination space.

## Report

`RMAVIS` allows the user to generate a downloadable pdf report, which by
default contains 1) a table of the `RMAVIS` results selected for inclusion,
and 2) tables containing the number of quadrats sampled by year and
group.

### Options

**Author**

A text input where the user is able to enter the name of the person/s
using `RMAVIS`.

**Project Name**

A text input where the user is able to enter the project name/name of
the site being analysed in `RMAVIS`.

**Report Options**

The user is able to select any of the results visualised in `RMAVIS` for
inclusion in the report, displayed in the table below.

```{r reportOptions_table, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="The RMAVIS results available for inclusion in the pdf report."}

reportOptions_table <- stack(lapply(reportOptions_options, names)) |>
  as.data.frame() |>
  dplyr::select("Results Group" = ind, "Results Value" = values)

kableExtra::kbl(x = reportOptions_table, 
                # format = "latex", 
                booktabs = TRUE,
                longtable = FALSE, 
                linesep = "") |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = TRUE)

```

## Download

At present the **Download** section of `RMAVIS` allows the user to
download a .xlsx file containing all the results from the `RMAVIS` session.
